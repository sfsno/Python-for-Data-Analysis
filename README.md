# Python-for-Data-Analysis project
Find the dataset here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified

The dataset is a survey of 1885 people regarding their drug use. They answered questions regarding their age, ethnicity, user of 18 different drugs and personality scores…Here is the information on each interested person:
•	Person information :
o	ID
o	Age
o	Gender
o	Education
o	Country
o	Ethinicity
•	Personality information :
o	Escore (Extraversion)
o	Oscore (Openess to experience)
o	Ascore (Agreeableness)
o	Cscore (Conscientiousness)
o	Impulsive (Impulsiveness)
o	SS (Sensation)
•	Information about their drug use :
o	Cannabis
o	Choc
o	Coke
o	Ecstasy
o	Heroin
o	Ketamin
o	Legalh
o	LSD
o	Meth
o	Mushrooms
o	Nicotine
o	Semer
o	VSA


The completed project is broken down into 4 parts:
o	Data-Preprocessing: Data cleaning, implementation of the legend provided with the dataset.
o	Data-Visualization: Exploration of data, search for correlation between data.
o	Moduling: Implementation of different models based on their personality in order to know if a user is a consumer or not.
o	Django: Allows you to display interactive graphs.

The code contains:
- Data pre-processing: encoding, normalization, imputation...
- Data visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn...)
- Modeling
Transformation of the model into a Django API 

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not an individual will use a drug based on their personality characteristics.


After machine learning we can conclude that:
We can create models that are effective in predicting whether a person is a consumer or not. On the other hand, we also notice that certain models are better than others, and give better results, depending on the drug.
