# Python-for-Data-Analysis project
Find the dataset here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified

The dataset is a survey of 1885 people regarding their drug use. They answered questions regarding their age, ethnicity, user of 18 different drugs and personality scoresâ€¦Here is the information on each interested person:
###	Person information :
-	ID
-	Age
-	Gender
-	Education
-	Country
-	Ethinicity
### Personality information :
-	Escore (Extraversion)
-	Oscore (Openess to experience)
-	Ascore (Agreeableness)
-	Cscore (Conscientiousness)
-	Impulsive (Impulsiveness)
-	SS (Sensation)
### Information about their drug use :
-	Cannabis
-	Choc
-	Coke
-	Ecstasy
-	Heroin
-	Ketamin
-	Legalh
-	LSD
-	Meth
-	Mushrooms
-	Nicotine
-	Semer
-	VSA


## The completed project is broken down into 4 parts:
-	Data-Preprocessing: Data cleaning, implementation of the legend provided with the dataset.
-	Data-Visualization: Exploration of data, search for correlation between data.
-	Moduling: Implementation of different models based on their personality in order to know if a user is a consumer or not.
-	Django: Allows you to display graphs.


The objective of this project is to predict whether or not an individual will use a drug based on their personality characteristics.


## After machine learning we can conclude that:
We can create models that are effective in predicting whether a person is a consumer or not. On the other hand, we also notice that some models are better than others, and give better results, depending on the drug.
